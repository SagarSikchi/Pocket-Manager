It has a sign in/ sign out option for users as well. Signed in users get access to advanced features. Temporary users have restricted view and access to the application.


Current version uses 1 Table: pocketmanager 
columns:fname, lname, email and password

A static gitHub page has been added to show the working protoype of the project. (The php files wont function. Will need to download and run the project on local host)
